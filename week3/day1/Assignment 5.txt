Assignment 5:
==============
 String str3 = new String("Kutty");
		 String str4 = new String("Kutty");
		 
		 if(str3==str4) {
			 System.out.println(" Same text");
		 }
		 else
			 System.out.println("Diff text");
		 
		 System.out.println("***");
ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘† Justify the above output



Justification:

Above program prints "Diff Text" as output. The reason is , 
1) when we use == operator to compare strings, it will compare memory locations of two strings. 
2) When we use new operator to declare strings, it will create new memory space for each string eventhough the variable value is same.

Suggestions:
1) use .equals to compare two string values.
2) If we declare as String <variable_name> = "<value>";   , it will reference the same memory location if the same string value is declared for other variable.
